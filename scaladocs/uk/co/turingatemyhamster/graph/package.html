          <div class="fullcommenttop" id="comment"><div class="comment cmt"><p>Graphs are central to many algorithms and to solving many real-world problems. This package provides an API for
working with various families of graph representations, while maximising the freedom of implementors to implement
graph storage and operations.</p><h4> Motivation </h4><p>In many applications of graphs, the vertices and edges represent interesting, application-domain values such as
places and roads, proteins and interactions, people and published papers. This API seeks to recognise this from
the outset, so that graphs are directly represented over their application-domain entities, without the need to
modify these or derive custom graph implementations.</p><p>In typical cases where application-domain values are represented as graphs, there are many graphs for the same
values. For example, people could be arranged into a graph by marriage, family trees, friendship. Given a graph
of people who phone each other, there are many graphs to be had by filtering the phonecalls by time of day,
date range, call length. However, from the point of view of the application, it probably makes sense to use the same
vertex and edge application-domain instances in these distinct graphs.</p><p>To support this, the <code>Graph</code> API uses type-classes to expose the graph structure, distinct from the graph, vertex or
edge types themselves.</p><h4> Maths </h4><p>The most common mathematical definition of a graph is: <code>G = {V, E⊆(V⨯V)}</code>. However, there are many related structures
that are sometimes called graphs, or given more specific names.</p><p>To account for this, the <code>Graph</code> type-class actually represents a slightly different structure:</p><p>  <code>G = {V, E, incidence:E-&gt;(V⨯V) }</code></p><p>where <code>V</code> and <code>E</code> are the application-domain values and incidence is a function that maps from each <code>E</code> to the
associated vertices.
This, in effect, hides the underlying structure of the vertices and edges, letting us describe all common graph
operations purely in terms of the application-domain values. Implementors are free to represent the graph in terms
of a graph over some other types <code>V'</code> and <code>E'</code> and a bijective mapping <code>Iv:V-&gt;V'</code>, <code>Ie:E-&gt;E'</code>.</p><p>The graph structure described so far is a binary, directed graph. The incidence range is an ordered pair.
If the graph is binary and undirected, then the incidence range is an unordered bag of cardinality 2.
If it is binary, undirected and without loops, then incidence range is sets of cardinality 2.
In a hypergraph, each edge can connect any number of vertices.
Here, the incidence type is a list of vertices (a bag, in the case of an un-directed graph).
Pseudographs require the incidence function to allow multiple edges to map to the same incident vertices.
True graphs require the incidence function to be bijective, so that it uniquely associates edges with their incident
vertices.</p><p>So, a generalized graph is some vertices, edges, and an incidence function and type, together with some restrictions
on the incidence function.</p><p><code>G = {Inc, V, E, incidence: E-&gt;Inc[V]}</code></p><p>Lastly, some graphs are infinite in extent while others are finite. For the finite case, it makes sense for the
vertex and edge sets to be represented directly by <code>Set</code> datastructures. For infinite representations, there are
other alternatives.
Sometimes it will be a cheep operation to see if a value is in one of these sets. Here, representing the collection
by its indicator function is sufficient.
Other times, it may be possible to iterate over members in some order, given that the iteration may not terminate.
Here, an <code>Iterable</code> is appropriate.
It's worth noting in passing that <code>Set</code> is both <code>Iterable</code> and has an <code>apply()</code> method that is an indicator
function.
